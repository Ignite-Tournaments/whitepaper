# Tipping System

Since one of the products developed by Ignite Tournaments is a streaming platform for gamers, tipping streamers is an additional feature. Tips can be given directly via TENKA or any of the supported tokens (which will be converted to TENKA first - please refer to the previous section for more details).

Every tip generates Gamer Points for both tipper and tipped Gamer. Tips are also subjected to the small TENKA commission fee.

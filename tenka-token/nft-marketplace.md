# NFT Marketplace

The Ignite Tournaments NFT Marketplace will be a central store in which ecosystem participants will be able to buy and share consumable or wearable NFTs from other players or directly from the Ignite Tournaments treasury (so called ‘first-hand’ or ‘originals’ NFTs).

Each item available via the store will be connected to different bonuses relevant to the Ignite Tournaments Ecosystem. These bonuses may include among others:

* free entry tickets for tournaments
* one-time or permanent bonus multipliers
* fees reduction
* access to special events
* other TBD benefits.

Buying and selling NFTs through the Ignite Tournaments NFT marketplace generates Gamer Points. It will also be subjected to a small TENKA commission applied per every transaction via the marketplace. (e.g. 2%)

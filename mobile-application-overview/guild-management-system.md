Ignite Tournaments will develop a guild management system to allow anyone to create a guild that other users can join. The guild management system will include the following features:

* Guild vs. Guild leaderboard that tracks guild performance as an aggregate of guild members’ win/loss ratios
* Internal guild member leaderboard with individual win/loss ratio tracking
* Ongoing tournaments in which guild members are presently participating
* Upcoming tournaments for which guild members have registered
* Past tournaments in which guild members have previously competed
* Guild treasury which allows guild members to donate a portion of their TENKA and NFT rewards for the purpose of future tournament sponsorship
* Guild tournament creation

# Global Statistics and Rankings

Ignite Tournaments will track and publicize global statistics for tournaments, including the number of tournaments played, rankings of players by tournaments won, rankings of guilds based on player win-loss ratios, tournaments entered, most winnings, among others. The majority of these statistics being tracked will be recorded on the blockchain.

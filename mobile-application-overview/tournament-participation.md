# Tournament Participation



![](<../.gitbook/assets/2 (1)>)

To compete in a tournament on Ignite Tournaments, users must download and install the Ignite Tournaments mobile application on their mobile device, which will be available on both iPhone or Android. In the future, tablets such as iPads will also be supported.

Once the application is installed, users will then register to gain access to the rest of the platform.

**User Registration**

Only registered users will be able to access the platform.

Users can register via social login or by filling out a form that asks for the user’s name, location, age, etc. along with their email address. After registration, users need to verify their email by entering a 6-digit verification code sent to their email.

In the future, we will likely support web 3.0 integrations for login and registration.

Once users have completed registration, they will be able to upload a profile picture and enter a bio. User profiles will include the following features:

* User bio / about section.
* The full history of tournaments a user has participated in or is registered for
* Win/loss ratio per game
* Number of games played
* NFT gallery that shows the NFTs the user has won in tournaments
* Any badges associated with tournaments
* Follow and subscribe to notifications functionality
* Add friend functionality

Users can also create teams and guilds from within their profiles.

Once registration has been completed, a user can then search for a tournament they wish to compete in either via the search bar on the home screen, or by browsing through the tournament feed.

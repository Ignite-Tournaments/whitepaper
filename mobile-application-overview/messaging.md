# Messaging

Messaging is part of Ignite Tournaments’ ethos to bring more connection and collaboration to the play-to-earn ecosystem.

At present, messaging is a minimal feature of the application and applies to tournament chats to enable users to communicate during tournaments.

In the future, the application will support direct messaging between users who are "Friends,” group chats, global game chats, as well as team and guild chats.

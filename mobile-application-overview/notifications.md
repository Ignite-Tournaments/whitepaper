# Notifications

There are two types of notifications – in-app notifications and push notifications that the users see on their home screen. While the in-app notifications may also be pushed to the screen when the app is not active, the push notifications may also be used for marketing/win-back purposes.

#### In-app notifications <a href="#_qsh70q" id="_qsh70q"></a>

Users can subscribe to:

* Other users
* Tournaments
* Matches

A user is automatically subscribed to tournaments they organize or take part in and matches that they participate in.

Users can receive in-app notifications about certain subscription-related events, these will be defined as they come up.

#### Push notifications <a href="#_3as4poj" id="_3as4poj"></a>

Push notifications are a device-level feed users see on their screen and may receive even when an app is not active. “Push notifications” permission is by default given to apps but may be revoked by the user. It is a good practice to allow them to switch on/off notifications based on their category.

# Tournament Streaming

The application intends to capture and render streams of all participants for a tournament, so that viewers can watch streams from any of the participants (and switch between them during game play).

Participants will allow and begin streaming by pressing a record button within the application, which will start sending a stream of their device to a streaming server. The system will then know if all participants required to stream have started stream, as a condition for beginning the tournament.

# Emergency Legislative Path

Emergency legislative path can be triggered only by the General Council or Technical Committee and is reserved for critical subjects (e.g. network security, financial stability, changes in core business model, etc.) Proposals submitted through the emergency legislative path are moved directly to general voting after 4 hours from submitting them. Voting season for such proposals is shortened to 24 hours and vacatio legis to 48 hours. Emergency proposals canâ€™t be subjected to veto.

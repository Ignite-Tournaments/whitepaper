# Standard Legislative Path

Governance of Ignite Tournaments will consist of the following steps:

1. Submitting proposal
2. Proposal upvoting period
3. Proposals shortlisting
4. Voting
5. Voting season
6. Emergency voting
7. Vacatio legis

**Submitting Proposal**

Submitting a proposal requires making a small TENKA temporary deposit on a lockup-vault (in order to avoid spam and encourage submitting only serious proposals). Exact amount required for deposit will be announced by the Ignite Tournaments General Council and might be subjected to adjustments based on TENKA value.

All temporary deposits are locked until their related proposal is either accepted or rejected. Depending on results, deposits will be:

* Locked for another 6 months (in case proposal is eventually rejected)
* Locked for 14 days after the end of vacatio legis (in case proposal is eventually accepted)

**Proposal Upvoting Period**

Each effectively submitted proposal is being moved to ‘upvoting period’ in which every proposal might be upvoted by any TENKA token holder. By the end of this period 5 proposals with the highest upvoting scores will be shortlisted by the Governance Committee.

**Proposal Shortlisting**

Both the Governance Council and Technical Committee have a right to veto submitted proposals (please see ‘_required majorities’_ section for more details). If a proposal is subjected to Veto, it is replaced by the next one with the highest upvoting score. If the proposal hasn’t been effectively vetoed it is being moved to global voting.

**General Voting**

Announced by the General Council 14 days in advance. Voting season lasts 7 days and is preceded by a shortlisting process of the most upvoted proposals. Every TENKA token holder which has staked TENKA can participate in the General voting (Please refer to the _‘voting power’_ section for more details).

**Vacatio Legis**

Period before the end of general voting and entering accepted proposals into force. Vacatio legis lasts 7 days.
